This repository is my portfolio. It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website presents information regarding my professional and personal works.
The portfolio is a compliation of my works in all fields that I am interested in.

It includes:
1. An introductory Home page
2. A page for my Tech projects and abilities
3. A page for my writing interests.

This project will be constantly updates as and when I undertake a project in a existing field or 
explore a new field.

Stay tuned for more updates on the website!
