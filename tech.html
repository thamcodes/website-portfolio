              As an engineer (almost there), technical projects are a must. Being at the intersection
              of hardware and software, I have experience in both these areas. Apart from personal 
              interest and exploring, I have also been taught these subjects as part of my curriculum. 
          </p>
          <p>
              I will always be learning and updating these projects and also adding new ones, so stay
              tuned!

            Yes, it is the very website you are reading this on! I always wanted a portfolio for my work, and I made it.
            The project uses HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript. It has a homepage, and multiple other pages embedded in it.
            This project will keep being updated as and when I do new things, but the main skeleton of it will remain same.

            This project entails a 3D-Printed Prosthetic Arm that can be controlled using EEG Signals.
            The hardware includes printing and building the 3D-Printed Prosthetic Arm. The software includes usage of Biomedical Signal processing, Python, multiple algorithms of Machine learning.
            The project runs on Arduino Uno Board. Non real-time output has already been achieved. I am currently wokring on making the project work in real-time.
